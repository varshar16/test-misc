**ERCOT Grid Behavior:** The five dashboards illustrate generation and load dynamics in ERCOT for day, week, month, and full year periods. **ERCOT only releases generation mix on a monthly basis, so even trailing 1-week dashboards cannot be populated. ERCOT does not release any marginal fuel data**. Average carbon intensity is computed from generation mix. Diurnal and weekday-weekend differences are readily apparent in the load dashboard (upper right). The year-long generation pattern (by source) illustrates the seasonal variation of renewable generation and how load variation by season drives conventional generation (coal, gas, biomass, nuclear, etc.) to meet the load requirement.
